    "*Maria Oktopodaki, the head of revenue management at BlueSky Airlines, has been struggling with one particularly problematic flight, between Lincoln (Nebraska) and New York. On that flight, the airline operates a small plane, with a capacity of 200 seats, and is offering two different fare classes: a full fare (FF), for 850USD, and a \\'super saver\\' (SS) fare, for 350USD. To qualify for the SS fare, customers must purchase at least 2 months in advance (before the flight date), and are required to have a Saturday-night stay in New York. In contrast, FF is very flexible, and is offered up until the date of the flight, if seats are still available. In fact, historically, the FF customers are almost exclusively business travelers, who always make last-minute purchases, and are not price-sensitive...* \n",
    "\n",
    "*Using historical data, Maria estimated that the mean demand for SS fares is roughly 130, and the mean demand for FF fares is roughly 55. She would like to build a model to guide her decisions. A key operational lever under her control is the \\'booking limit\\' for the SS fare, i.e., how many seats to make available to SS customers. Historically, that value was set at 120, but Maria is not sure that’s right. She knows that, the larger that limit is, the fewer seats she might have available for (higher-paying) FF customers...*"
