    "## Example BlueSky Airlines\n",
    "*Maria Oktopodaki, the head of revenue management at BlueSky Airlines, has been struggling with one particularly problematic flight, between Lincoln (Nebraska) and New York. On that flight, the airline operates a small plane, with a capacity of 200 seats, and is offering two different fare classes: a full fare (FF), for 850USD, and a \\'super saver\\' (SS) fare, for 350USD. To qualify for the SS fare, customers must purchase at least 2 months in advance (before the flight date), and are required to have a Saturday-night stay in New York. In contrast, FF is very flexible, and is offered up until the date of the flight, if seats are still available. In fact, historically, the FF customers are almost exclusively business travelers, who always make last-minute purchases, and are not price-sensitive...* \n",
    "\n",
    "*Using historical data, Maria estimated that the mean demand for SS fares is roughly 130, and the mean demand for FF fares is roughly 55. She would like to build a model to guide her decisions. A key operational lever under her control is the \\'booking limit\\' for the SS fare, i.e., how many seats to make available to SS customers. Historically, that value was set at 120, but Maria is not sure that’s right. She knows that, the larger that limit is, the fewer seats she might have available for (higher-paying) FF customers...*"

If you have no idea how to do this in Python, you could google \"numpy correlated random numbers\" and the first link for me is to https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.multivariate_normal.html that describes how to do it. The only wrinkle is you need to specify the covariance matrix. I spare you the details, but for the two series of demands this is a 2x2 matrix with the top left element being the variance (variance = std squared) of SS, the bottom right element being the variance of FF and the other two elements being the covariance."

The **Python101** notebook contains some more detail on dictionaries, package usage and goes through a quick example of how to build a neural network in 15 lines of code. Hopefully you enjoyed this introduction into Python and could glimpes at the power of knowing how to program. May your code be bug-free and your stackoverflow reputation infinite."
